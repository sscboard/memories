<p>It is with a heavy heart that I have to announce that the Spencerville Skating Club has to shut down due to a shortage coaches, parent volunteers and PAs. <br><br>I know many of you will be sad to see the club close as you or your child have learned to skate here, as well as watched and participated in the yearly ice show. </p>



<p>The Prescott Skating Club has so kindly agreed to take over our ice time on Tuesdays so that you may continue to skate in our community.  Please contact them at prescottfigureskatingclub @ gmail.com to have your registration questions answered. </p>



<p>It has been a pleasure getting to know everyone for the past 14 years that my girls have been skating, and I wish everyone the best of luck! Thank you,  </p>
